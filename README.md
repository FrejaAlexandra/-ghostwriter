The publishing industry has ignored underrepresented groups for too long and Ghostwriter wants to put the power back in the writers's pen. Ghostwriter wants to rewrite a world where authors aren't repressed by the publishing industry and are able to choose their own editors, illustrators and distributors. Where they aren't silenced by the limitations placed upon them by those who don't understand and don't support them. At Ghostwriter we believe that you know how to write for people like you. And we're making investment fun and supporting a whole new generation of authors.

Still in it's 'dummy phase', our hopes for Ghostwriter will be in further production in the near future. Authors will be able able to upload their books and users can buy and sell shares in those books. As real time books sales rise and fall, so will the share value. We're making investment fun and accessible, as well as hosting a platform which celebrates the independence of writers and enables them to own their own work.
